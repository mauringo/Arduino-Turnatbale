# Arduino-Turntable

The idea is to use an Arduino UNO to feed an inverter with three phase sPWM signals
in order to run a synchronous motor at constant spees. 

The Firmware for the Arduino UNO has been developed starting from the Martin Nawrath's DDS 
software:

Thank you very much!

The motor i am using is a modified Nidec 24H667H010 bldc motor: removing the integrated 
control circuit it's possible to run the motor like a synchronous motor.

Here there are some details of the final product
